*NOTES ABOUT OUR DECISIONS*

_Shipping weights_: Since our team is only shipping costumes, we've decided that to generate shipping weights we will use a generic weight of 3 lbs. per item. If we were a real business we would very occasionally lose money on single ships, but since the vast majority of costumes do not weigh that much, the profit we make on the others would cover the occasional deficit on something like a suit of armor.

_Box sizing_: Each side of a box is 12", so our BOX costant is 12, and a box when shipped is (BOX * 3) for volume.
